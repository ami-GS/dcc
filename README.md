# dcc
Daiki C Compiler

### Notice
This is for my understandings of interpreter-compiler.

Currently the usage is limited, but you can use example/ directory for testing.

'''
$ git clone https://github.com/ami-GS/dcc
$ cd dcc
$ make
$ dcc example/fib.c -sm

## TODO
These are TODO list specilly I would like to implement.

- Use syntax tree for parse expression. Currently another method is tested and it cause implementation difficulty. (Partially done, but <span style="color:red">partially degrading</span>)

- Enable global variable initialization. In assembler generated by gcc, it seems to be initialized before associated functions are called.

- Write linker.

## Specification

- Stack based (no registers)

- My own designed assemblers

### Supported types
Types below are supported.

& is not supported stil. (this will be supported as unary operation below)

- Int

- Char (string)

### Passed statements
statements below were properly translated to assembler with simple processing.
like

```c
int a;
a = 0;
while (a < 5) {
      a = a + 1;
}
```

- whlie, do-while

- for

- if, else if, else

- pre & post position incre & decrement

- switch, case, default (nest capable)

- continue

- break

- function, prototype, call it (with arguments)

- local & global (array) variable declaration (with initialization)


### Passed preprocessor directives

- \#define (const and function) recursive only for const type

- \#include (possible to file nesting compile)

- \#if, #elif, #else, #ifdef, #ifndef and #endif


### Passed expressions

- binary operations (+ - * / %) without pointer addressing

- unary operations (+ - * ! ++ --)

- binary bit operations (& | ^ << >>)

- unary bit operation (~)

- binary boolean operations (== != <= => >= =< && ||)

- compound operators (+= -= *= /= %= &= |= ^= <<= >>=)

- comment (// /**/)
